Here are the changes made:

Initialized the candidate variable to the default value (TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY) in case no candidate is found.
Used an else if statement to avoid checking event again if event.partitionKey is already defined.
Used the toString() method to ensure that the resulting hash is always a string.
Used method chaining to simplify the code and improve readability.
Removed unnecessary conditional statement around the typeof check, since the JSON.stringify method always returns a string.
