Ticket 1: Add a custom id field to the Agents table

Description: Add a new field to the Agents table to allow Facilities to save custom ids for Agents they work with.

Acceptance Criteria:

A new field named custom_id is added to the Agents table
The custom_id field is unique and not null
The custom_id field is indexed for quick lookups
The custom_id field is visible to Facilities in the Agent list view
Facilities can edit the custom_id field in the Agent detail view
The custom_id field is used in the Shifts table to associate Agents with Shifts
Time/effort estimate: 2-3 days

Implementation details:

Add a migration script to create the custom_id field in the Agents table
Add an index to the custom_id field for quick lookups
Update the Shifts table to use the custom_id field to associate Agents with Shifts
Ticket 2: Update getShiftsByFacility function to use custom Agent ids

Description: Update the getShiftsByFacility function to use custom Agent ids instead of internal database ids.

Acceptance Criteria:

The getShiftsByFacility function retrieves all Shifts worked that quarter for the specified Facility
The Agent metadata returned by the function includes the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
The function is thoroughly tested and no regressions are introduced
Time/effort estimate: 1-2 days

Implementation details:

Modify the getShiftsByFacility function to use the custom Agent id to retrieve Agent metadata from the Agents table
Update the function's query to join the Agents table on the Shifts table using the custom Agent id
Update the function's return value to include the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
Ticket 3: Update generateReport function to use custom Agent ids

Description: Update the generateReport function to use custom Agent ids instead of internal database ids.

Acceptance Criteria:

The generateReport function converts a list of Shifts into a PDF report
The Agent ids displayed on the report are the custom Agent ids saved by the Facility
The function is thoroughly tested and no regressions are introduced
Time/effort estimate: 2-3 days

Implementation details:

Modify the generateReport function to use the custom Agent id to retrieve Agent metadata from the Agents table
Update the function's query to join the Agents table on the Shifts table using the custom Agent id
Update the function's report generation code to use the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
Ticket 4: Update the UI to display custom Agent ids

Description: Update the UI to display the custom Agent ids saved by the Facilities instead of the internal database ids.

Acceptance Criteria:

The custom Agent ids are visible to Facilities in the Agent list view
Facilities can edit the custom Agent id in the Agent detail view
The custom Agent id is displayed on the Shifts list view
The custom Agent id is displayed on the generated reports
Time/effort estimate: 1-2 days

Implementation details:

Modify the Agent list view to display the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
Modify the Agent detail view to allow Facilities to edit the custom Agent id
Modify the Shifts list view to display the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
Modify the report generation code to use the custom Agent id instead of the internal database id
